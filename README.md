Big Data processing

In this subject, we have made 3 assignments:

- **Hadoop and Spark** assignment, in which we have performed easy tasks using the **MapReduce** paradigm (Folder [MapReduce](https://github.com/Ocete/mcd-pdge/tree/main/MapReduce))

- **CUDA** coding assignment, in which we have implemented simple operations with vectors and matrixes using the GPU as the computing engine, and we have explained a few **Quantum Computing** algorithms that were proposed to us. (Folder [CUDA-Cuantica](https://github.com/Ocete/mcd-pdge/tree/main/CUDA-Cuantica) )

- **Optional** assignment in which we have explained (in a very simplified way) the [Bachelor's thesis](https://github.com/Ocete/TFG) of one of the components of this group:  [Jos√© Antonio](https://github.com/Ocete)
